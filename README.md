Penalty Shootout Practice

This game is made to practice penalty shootout (soccer). 

Before you run the game, make sure that you download all the necessary images.

To run the game, simply run 'penaltykickpractice.py'. 
You are the kicker (dog) and the computer is a goalie (cat). 


There are 3 directions that you can choose from - Left, Center, Right
To kick the ball, simply press on either left, up, or right arrow keys from the keyboard. 
As soon as you press on the arrow key, the ball will start moving in the direction that you put in. 

If the direction of the goalie is different from the direction of the ball, it will print 'Goal'.
If the direction of the goalie is the same from the direction of the ball, it will print 'No Goal'. 

Enjoy!
