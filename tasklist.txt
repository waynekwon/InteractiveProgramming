Task List

1. Instead of 'Messi', we'll try to have a character
2. We'll have a background of crowds behind the goal
3. We will have 3 directions - left, center, right
4. Our games will be USER vs COMPUTER
5. When we are shooting, computer will choose directions using random integers
 - 3 numbers would each correspond to 3 directions
 - We will have to move the ball in the right direction
 - We will have to move the goalie in the right direction so that when it blocks the ball, the graphic doesn't look weird
6. When Computer is shooting, both the goalie and kicker will choose their directions based on random integers
7. We will count the scores - if the directions match, it's not a goal, and if the directions don't match, it's a goal
8. If a player scores, we'll have sound of crowds going crazy, and if he doesn't score, the crowd will boo
9. It will be out of 5 shots for each players
10. In the end, whoever scored more will win
